        <ul>
          <li><span class="bold">1858</span> - born in Paris, France</li>
          <li><span class="bold">1870</span> - with the beginning of the Franco-Prussian War, his family is forced to move to London. Before the war's end, however, mother sent 12-year-old Rudolf to Augsburg to live with his aunt and uncle, to become fluent in German and to visit the Königliche Kreis-Gewerbeschule (Royal County Vocational College).</li>
          <li><span class="bold">1875</span> - receives a scholarship to the Royal Bavarian Polytechnic of Munich, where he studies thermodynamics under Professor Karl Paul Gottfried von Linde.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">1879</span> - although unable to graduate in his class because he is ill with typhoid, he makes wise use of his time by gaining practical experience in engineering at the Sulzer Brothers Machine Works in Winterthur, Switzerland.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">1880</span> - graduates with flying colors and moves to Paris to work with his former professor, Karl Paul Gottfried von Linde, in his refrigeration and ice plant business, Linde Refrigeration Machinery.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">1881</span> - becomes the director of the Linde plant.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">1883</span> - marries Martha Flasche and they have two sons Rudolf Jr. and Eugen, and a daughter, Heddy.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">1885</span> - builds a working ammonia engine to try and improve fuel efficiency but it does not meet his expectations so he begins to consider other options.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">1890</span> - moves to Berlin and takes charge of the Linde engineering office. Diesel believes that it is possible to build an engine which is four times more efficient, then existing steam engine. He begins to work on his project to design an efficient engine.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">1892</span> - files a patent in Berlin for a “new rational heat engine” - an engine that burnt using what was then the cheapest fuel available, powdered coal.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">1893</span> - is granted the patent for the “Working Method and Design for Combustion Engines”. Begins prototype testing his engine. The trials are successful but the engine is not commercially viable. He finds workarounds and improvements for issues including changing the fuel from coal dust to refined mineral oil and later to heavy petroleum.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">1897</span> - successfully introduces the first 25-horsepower 4-stroke one-cylinder compression engine, with an efficiency of 26.2 percent.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">1898</span> - founds his own disel engine factory. Engine becomes well-known after it is displayed in the Munich Exhibition.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">1903</span> - virst vessel with diesel engine is built</li>
          <li><span class="bold">1913</span> - on September 29 boards the steamer “Dresden” to cross the English Channel. En route to London to attend a Consolidated Diesel Manufacturing meeting, he vanished. During the morning call, his cabin was found to be empty and his bed not slept in; he was never seen alive again.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>“I am firmly convinced that the automobile engine will come, and then I consider my life’s work complete.”
